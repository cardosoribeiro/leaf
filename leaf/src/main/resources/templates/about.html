      Infections are caused by bacteria, fungi, other
      microorganisms, viruses, and prions. From the
      beginning of time, infections have been a major cause
      of illness and death. Powerful infectious diseases that
      sometimes give rise to epidemics like smallpox,
      influenza, tuberculosis, and plague have had a major
      impact on large numbers of people in the world for      
      centuries. The types of infections that affect humans
      include common bacterial diseases, such as
      pneumonia, as well as viral disorders, such as chicken
      pox.      
    </p>

    <p>
      Noninfectious diseases include all the medical and
      surgical conditions that are not mental disorders or
      infections. This is a broad category that includes
      muscular and skeletal conditions, cardiovascular
      disease, autoimmune diseases, kidney diseases, lung
      diseases, and diseases affecting the gastrointestinal
      tract.      
    </p>    

    <p>
      Mental disorders are conditions that affect thinking,
      behavior, personality, judgment, and brain function.
      Examples of mental disorders include anxiety,
      depression, eating disorders, mood disorders,
      schizophrenia, and personality disorders. Mental
      disorders are often underdiagnosed and may not be
      publicly disclosed because of fear of the stigma
      associated with mental illness or because of a lack of
      knowledge about its causes, diagnostic methods of
      detection, or available therapies and treatments.      
    </p>    

    <p>
      Some diseases that run in families are categorized as
      genetic diseases; these include depression, diabetes, and
      some cancers. In some cases, risk factors and the
      causes of these diseases are known. However, for many
      diseases, the exact causes are still unknown.      
    </p>    

    <p>
      Bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms cause
      infections by penetrating into human or animal
      organs, tissues, and cells and then replicating to cause
      disease. Microorganisms can cause disease by
      damaging and killing human cells, producing toxins,
      and creating an inflammatory response. Some
      microorganisms are harmless in normal healthy
      individuals, but many microorganisms can cause
      disease if they penetrate the bodyâ€™s normal host
      defenses and immune system. Certain organisms that
      are less virulent and do not normally cause disease are
      capable of causing opportunistic infections in
      individuals who have weakened immune systems.      
    </p>    

    <p>
      One of the unique characteristics of infectious
      diseases is the variety of mechanisms by which these
      diseases are transmitted or acquired. Some infectious
      diseases are considered communicable diseases and can
      be transmitted person to person through direct contact
      with infected persons or a contaminated environment,
      large droplets that are shed in close proximity when
      infected people cough or sneeze, and airborne
      transmission, especially in contained environments
      with limited air circulation.            
    </p>

    <p>
      There are also a number of infectious diseases that
      are transmitted through exchange of body fluids or as
      sexually transmitted diseases. Some are transmitted as
      blood-borne pathogens through transfusions or they
      are spread when people share contaminated needles or
      when they have unprotected intercourse with infected
      persons. Still other infections occur through fecaloral
      contamination, when food or water become
      contaminated with bacteria or viruses, or both, causing
      vomiting and diarrhea. Infections such as rabies can
      be acquired from animals; this is called zoonotic
      transmission.
